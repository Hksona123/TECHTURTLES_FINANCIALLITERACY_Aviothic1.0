        <h1>STRATEGIES FOR PROMOTING FINANCIAL MANAGEMNET</h1>
    
        
        <p>In recent years, the promotion of financial literacy has come to the forefront across the country, focusing on Canadians of all ages, and specifically youth and younger generations. It was 2011 when the Financial Literacy Action Group (a coalition of non-profit organizations that raises awareness and highlights programs and services to help Canadians improve their financial knowledge and skills) organized the first Financial Literacy Month, which takes place every November.4 In the first year, there were 200 events and that number expanded to 1,266 workshops, seminars and events in 2014, taking place in every province and territory in Canada.5 And since that time, the number of initiatives has continued to grow.</p>
    
        <h2>5 main strategies will be:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying short and long term goals</li>
            <p> A simple approach is to think about and itemize objectives at five-year, 10-year and 20-year intervals, for example. Noting them concretely can be a great starting point for conversations with a professional advisor to then put the right planning and investment strategies in place.</p>
            <li>Having a suitable emergency funds</li>
            <p> As a rule of thumb, for an individual this should be roughly three times your monthly expenses, and for a couple or those with kids, it should be six times your monthly expenses.</p>
            <li>Rethinking spending as part of your overall budget</li>
            <p>This may include items such as buying lunch every day, coffee and transportation choices. Even small adjustments in areas such as these can add up over the course of the year, and may equate to savings that could be directed to an RRSP or TFSA, for example.
            </p>
            <li>Developing a better knowledge of both registered and non-registered investment option</li>
            <p>Part of this should include an understanding of the tax-sheltering advantages associated with registered programs, and the potential benefits of non-registered accounts for shorter-term goals. Again here, the knowledge and assistance of a professional advisor can be very useful in this regard to cater solutions to your particular circumstances.</p>
            <li>Being disciplined in paying down any debt</li>
            <p> Itâ€™s also important to understand the importance of making payments on time and paying more than the minimum amount, if possible, in relation to credit rating.</p>
        </ul>
